- [ ] Unicode (string_literals test) Support + escape sequences (different from Python)
- [x] Zig test system (not required, but would be nice)
- [ ] threadlocal -> threading and python, shame on me for thinking of implementing this
- [ ] Proper error messages
- [ ] Pointers [Volatile, Align, AllowZero] not supported
- [ ] Opaque
- [ ] Labeled While, For, Switch not supported, probably easy to implement using 'with'
- [ ] While continue
- [ ] inline fn not added (did not feel like it today)
- [ ] Passing args to functions (lists, strings, structs, etc) from python
- [ ] usingnamespace
- [ ] inline/global assembly
- [ ] C Interop (Headers, varargs etc)
- [ ] Probably missed a lot of things (so that too!!! I don't have time)
